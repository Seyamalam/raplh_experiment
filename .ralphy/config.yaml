# Ralphy Configuration for Advanced Heart Disease Benchmarking
# Project: Heart_Disease_Deep_Benchmark

project:
  name: "heart_disease_benchmark"
  language: "Python"
  framework: "Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, PyTorch, TabNet"  
  description: "Benchmarking 20+ ML/DL models on Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv for efficiency and performance balance."

commands:
  # Ensuring the agent verifies script syntax and basic execution
  test: "python -c 'import pandas as pd; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; print(\"Environment Ready\")'"
  lint: "flake8 ."

rules:
  - "Model Progression: Start with simple baselines (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes), move to tree ensembles (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM), and finish with Deep Learning (MLP, TabNet) and complex Ensembles (Stacking, Voting)."
  - "Model Quantity: Implement and benchmark at least 20 unique model configurations, including hybrid and ensemble variations."
  - "Evaluation Metrics: Calculate and record Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient), Inference Latency (ms), and Peak Memory Usage."
  - "Data Handling: Perform rigorous preprocessing including handling outliers, feature scaling (Standard/MinMax), and encoding categorical variables."
  - "Result Storage: Save all comparative metrics into a master file named 'benchmark_results.csv'."
  - "Visualization: Generate PNG diagrams for ROC/PR curves, Feature Importance, and a 'Performance vs. Efficiency' scatter plot comparing all 20+ models."
  - "Research Documentation: Author a comprehensive research paper in 'Research_Paper.md' containing an Abstract, Methodology, Results Analysis (citing the generated CSV and PNGs), and Conclusion."
  - "Automation: If a training script fails, analyze the error output and self-correct the implementation."
  - "Scientific Standard: The research paper must follow the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) structure, targeting Q1 medical informatics journal standards."
  - "Skill Leveraging: Before implementation, read and apply relevant advanced coding playbooks found in OpenCode skill directories to ensure optimized model architectures."
  - "Model Depth: Train 20+ models, progressing from baseline statistical models to deep learning (TabNet, MLP) and advanced ensembles (Bayesian-optimized Stacking and Soft-Voting)."
  - "Statistical Rigor: Include 5-fold cross-validation for all models and calculate 95% confidence intervals for primary metrics (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1)."
  - "Efficiency Benchmarking: Measure and report 'Efficiency-Adjusted Performance'—a custom metric balancing inference latency, memory footprint, and predictive power."
  - "Visualization: Produce publication-ready PNGs: multi-model ROC/PR comparison curves, SHAP value plots for feature importance, and a 3D scatter plot for the Performance-Efficiency-Complexity trade-off."
  - "Data Archiving: Save all hyperparameter logs and raw performance data into 'master_benchmark_results.csv' for reproducibility."
