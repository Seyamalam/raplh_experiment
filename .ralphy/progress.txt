# Ralphy Progress Log

- [✓] 2026-01-27 17:32 - Benchmark 20+ models on Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv. Transition from baseline to deep learning/ensembles. Calculate Q1-level evaluation metrics, generate publication-ready PNG visualizations, and author a high-quality Q1-standard research paper in Research_Paper.md.
- [✓] 2026-01-27 18:05 - Extend the benchmark: 1) Implement Nested Cross-Validation for the top 5 models to ensure zero leakage. 2) Create complex multi-stage Stacked Ensembles using Meta-Learners (e.g., Ridge or MLP). 3) Conduct a 'Data Scarcity' study by training models on 10%, 25%, and 50% of the dataset to analyze stability. 4) Build end-to-end Scikit-Learn Pipelines with automated Feature Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning. 5) Update Research_Paper.md with a dedicated section on 'Model Robustness and Pipelining Efficiency' including new Learning Curve plots.
